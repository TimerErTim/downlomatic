## Installation

Go to the [release section](https://github.com/TimerErTim/downlomatic/releases) and download the latest version for your
operating system. You can choose the installer or the portable version. If you choose the portable, extract the .zip
file to your desired destination. Inside the extracted archive you will find an executable "Downlomatic" file. You can
create a shortcut to this file and place it on the desktop or the start menu for easier access.

## Usage

Now you can start the GUI by double-clicking either said shortcut, or the executable directly. If you want to start it
per command line, you can get more information by executing `Downlomatic --help`.

## Support

If you need help, you can always open a new [issue](https://github.com/TimerErTim/downlomatic/issues)
explaining the problem you are encountering. You can reach me at <timerertim@gmail.com> for personal and administrative
business.

## Credits

I want to thank my mother.  
No really, thanks to her the idea behind this project was brought up.

## Project State

I, the project owner, am currently attending
the [higher technical college of Grieskirchen](https://github.com/HTBLA-Grieskirchen). My education takes me about as
much time as a full time job, not counting homework and similar tasks. Because of this, the development pace is not as
fast as it could be. Nonetheless, I am committed to this project and will continue to work on it. Just be aware that
development might be or become a little slow.
