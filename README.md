## Installation

Go to the [release section](https://github.com/TimerErTim/downlomatic/releases) and download the latest version for your
operating system. Extract the .zip file to your desired destination. Inside the extracted archive you will find a folder
called "bin" containing a "downlomatic" file. You can create a shortcut to this file (or to the equally named .bat file
if you happen to use Windows).

## Usage

Now you can start the GUI by double-clicking either said shortcut, or the target file directly. If you want to start it
per command line, you can get more information by executing `downlomatic --help`.

## Support

If you need help, you can always open a new [issue](https://github.com/TimerErTim/downlomatic/issues)
explaining the problem you are encountering. You can reach me at <timerertim@gmail.com> for personal and administrative
business.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome. This can be done by creating issues, promoting the project, implement more media
providers/hosts or working on the source code. Everything that helps the project growing is deeply appreciated.  

Please read through the [contribution guideline](CONTRIBUTING.md) before contributing as it contains information which
may be helpful for you.

## Roadmap

- [x] Create easily extendable server

- [ ] Add more supported media providers

## Credits

I want to thank my mother.  
No really, thanks to her the idea behind this project was brought up.

## License

## Project State

I, the project owner, am currently attending
the [higher technical college of Grieskirchen](https://github.com/HTBLA-Grieskirchen). My education takes me about as
much time as a full time job, not counting homework and similar tasks. Because of this, the development pace is not as
fast as it could be. Nonetheless, I am committed to this project and will continue to work on it. Just be aware that
development might be or become a little slow.
